## Strengths (grouped)
### OCR / Computer Vision
- Document understanding and extraction workflows
- Field mapping strategies with validation-first design
- Confidence scoring, fallbacks, and explainable extraction for debugging

### Retrieval (RAG)
- Ingestion → chunking → embeddings → index persistence → retrieval → response generation
- Retrieval gating and conservative behavior when evidence is weak
- Reproducible indexing and operational hygiene

### Backend / Services
- API design and integration work
- Data validation and structured outputs
- Logging and operational visibility patterns

### Shipping discipline
- CI/CD practices, dependency pinning, automated checks
- Testing mindset and defensive engineering

### Embedded fundamentals
- Real-time pipeline considerations
- Sensor integration patterns (high level)

## Public-safe outcomes (approved)
- **High accuracy OCR field-mapping** on a defined document set using a validation-first approach.
- **35% scheduling efficiency improvement** from workflow automation work (public-safe summary).
- Delivered full-stack functionality for real users (public-safe summary).
- **89.33% model accuracy** on FashionMNIST (public/public-demo context).

## Experience (sanitized summaries)
### Document automation (OCR/CV)
- Built a production OCR pipeline with multi-layer validation, confidence scoring, and audit logging.
- Delivered structured outputs suitable for downstream systems and user review.

### Retrieval systems (RAG)
- Developed retrieval pipelines and demos, emphasizing reproducibility and guardrails for low-evidence queries.
- Improved production readiness with CI checks and dependency management.

### Confidential / NDA work (high level only)
- Contributed to engineering foundations and production readiness on confidential work where details are restricted.
- Approved line: “Details can be discussed at a high level in interviews.”

## Projects (sanitized case studies)
### OCR document automation (public-safe)
- **Outcome**: High accuracy field-mapping on a defined set.
- **Approach**: validation-first extraction, confidence scoring, and structured output mapping.
- **Reliability**: multi-layer checks, fallbacks, and audit logging for traceability.
- **Stack (high level)**: Python, OpenCV, OCR tooling, PDF/structured outputs, LLM APIs where appropriate.

### RAG assistant (public-safe)
- **Outcome**: retrieval system demo connecting users to relevant information quickly (details public-safe).
- **Approach**: ingestion → embeddings → persistent index → retrieval → response generation.
- **Reliability**: reproducible indexing runs, retrieval gating when evidence is weak.
- **Stack (high level)**: Python, FAISS, sentence-transformers, UI demo tooling.

### Embedded / edge foundations (public-safe)
- **Outcome**: contributed to reliable real-time pipeline foundations (public-safe).
- **Approach**: sensor integration patterns and timing-consistency considerations.
- **Reliability**: defensive design for constrained, real-time contexts.

### Confidential AI product build (NDA)
- **Outcome**: production readiness and delivery foundations on confidential work.
- **Approach**: architecture and delivery practices at a high level.
- **Reliability**: testing/validation patterns, release hygiene, operational checks (no internal artifacts).
