### Global voice rules
- Short sentences. Concrete nouns/verbs. No hype.
- Prefer “I ship/build/own/deliver” over “passionate about”.
- No sensitive academic/legal detail. No NDA client/startup naming.
- Do **not** claim degree completion.

## Hero (Home)
**H1:** Matome Mbowene  
**Subhead:** AI/ML Engineer focused on Computer Vision, OCR automation, and retrieval systems (RAG).  
**Body:** I build production-ready pipelines with validation, clear failure modes, and measurable outcomes. Based in Cape Town, South Africa.  

**Primary CTA:** Email Matome  
**Secondary CTAs:** View Projects • Resume (PDF)

**Proof strip (pick 2–3):**
- 100% OCR field‑mapping accuracy on a production document workflow (with validation layers)
- Shipped end‑to‑end retrieval pipelines (ingestion → embeddings → index → retrieval → response)
- Reliability-first delivery: logging, fallbacks, and confidence scoring

## Projects
**Section title:** Projects  
**Section intro:** A few recent builds that show how I ship: outcome first, then reliability.

### Project card template (Proof pattern)
- **Outcome:** (1 measurable line)
- **Constraints:** (1 line: noisy scans, latency, limited memory, NDA, etc.)
- **Approach:** (1–2 lines)
- **Reliability:** (1 line: validation, tests, monitoring, fallbacks)
- **Stack:** (inline tags)

### OCR Document Automation (public-safe)
**One-liner:** OCR + mapping pipeline that turns scanned documents into structured outputs.
- **Outcome:** 100% field‑mapping accuracy on the target document set.
- **Constraints:** noisy scans, layout variance, strict correctness requirements.
- **Approach:** OCR extraction + context-aware mapping + deterministic rules where needed.
- **Reliability:** multi-layer validation, confidence scoring, audit logs, and fallbacks.
- **Stack:** Python, OpenCV, OCR, PDF forms, LLM APIs

### RAG Assistant (public-safe)
**One-liner:** Retrieval system that grounds answers in indexed content.
- **Outcome:** Working end‑to‑end pipeline with persistent indexing and a usable demo.
- **Constraints:** retrieval quality, repeatability, safety when sources are weak.
- **Approach:** chunking/embedding → FAISS index → top‑k retrieval → constrained generation.
- **Reliability:** deterministic indexing, guardrails, and “no answer” behavior when retrieval is insufficient.
- **Stack:** Python, FAISS, sentence-transformers, LLM APIs, Streamlit

### Embedded / Edge AI Foundations (public-safe)
**One-liner:** Real-time sensing foundations for edge deployment.
- **Outcome:** Contributed to data/firmware architecture decisions for reliable sensor timing.
- **Constraints:** latency, limited compute, noisy sensor inputs.
- **Approach:** sensor fusion pipeline design + integration planning.
- **Reliability:** timing discipline, signal integrity checks, and incremental testing.
- **Stack:** Embedded, C/C++, STM32, sensor fusion

### Confidential Product Build (NDA)
**One-liner:** Ongoing work on an AI-driven product—details limited by NDA.
- **Outcome:** Delivery on core product foundations and production readiness.
- **Constraints:** confidentiality, evolving requirements, tight iteration cycles.
- **Approach:** architecture, backend integration, and safe LLM feature delivery.
- **Reliability:** CI/CD hygiene, dependency controls, and guardrails.
- **Stack:** Backend, LLMs, CI/CD (details available at a high level in interviews)

## About (Credibility + Journey)
**Section title:** About  

**What I do:** I build AI systems that are reliable in production—document pipelines, retrieval systems, and backend services that support them. I optimize for correctness, debuggability, and measurable impact.  

**How I work:** I like clear requirements, strong validation, and simple systems that fail safely. I document assumptions, add tests where they matter, and ship in small iterations.  

**Credentials (discreet):**
- University of Cape Town — Computer Science & Computer Engineering (coursework)
- Dell Young Leaders Scholar
- Google Cloud Career Launchpad (EMEA)
- Google Cloud skill badge: Multimodal RAG (Gemini) — Credly

**Journey (public-safe):** My path has been longer than typical, shaped by real constraints and persistence. I stayed focused on building skills and shipping real work, and I’m ready to contribute in industry now.
